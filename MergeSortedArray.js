/*You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.*/

const merge=function(num1,m,num2,n){
    let i=m-1;
    let j=n-1;
    let k=m+n-1;

    while(i>=0&&j>=0){
        if(num1[i]>num2[j]){
            num1[k]=num1[i];
            i--;
        }else{
            num1[k]=num2[j];
            j--;
        }
        k--;
    }
while(j>=0){
    num1[k]=num2[j];
    j--;
    k--;
}
return num1;
}

console.log(merge([1,2,3,0,0,0],3,[2,5,6],3));
